## Problem Statement:
You are given 1,000 Wi-Fi hotspots randomly placed in a 5x5 km area, each broadcasting on one of 5 channels. Hotspots must be at least 50m apart, and two hotspots broadcasting on the same channel within 275m interfere with each other.

The goal is to generate this data, minimize interference by adjusting channel assignments, and visualize the results.
